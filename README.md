# Linear Regression
<hr>
 Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
 The case of one independent variable is called **simple linear regression** ; for more than one, the process is called **multiple linear regression**

**In this particular notebook**,
We are predicting the prices of houses using different independent variables like No. of Rooms, Area Population, etc.

## Advantages of Linear Regression 
* Simple implementation
* Performance on linearly seperable datasets
* Overfitting can be reduced by regularization

## Disadvantages of Linear Regression
* Prone to underfitting
* Sensitive to outliers
* Linear Regression assumes that the data is independent
